# Cosmopolitan-artifact-mirror
A mirror of [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) release tarballs for use with the Julia [Artifacts](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Artifacts/) system.

This mirror only exists because Julia artifacts have to be `.tar.gz` archives instead of `.zip` archives, which Cosmopolitan provides directly on their [releases](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases) page.
