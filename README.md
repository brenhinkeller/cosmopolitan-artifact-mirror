# cosmopolitan-artifact-mirror
A mirror of [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) release tarballs for use with the Julia Artifacts system.

This mirror only exists because Julia artifacts have to be `.tar.gz` archives instead of `.zip` archives, which [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) provides directly.
